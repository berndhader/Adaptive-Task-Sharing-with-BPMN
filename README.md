# BPMN-Extension for Franka Emika Desk

## About
The BPMN-Desk extension enables the creation and execution of collaborative human-robot processes using the cobot Panda by Franka Emika.  

[Business Process Model and Notation](https://www.bpmn.org) (short BPMN) is a visual modeling language for business processes. By using a so-called BPMN-engine since version 1.2 also the execution of the processes is possible. For the execution of the created human-robot processes Camunda BPM was used. [Camunda BPM](https://camunda.com/) is a widespread open source project, which provides various tools for modelling as well as for executing BPMN 2.0 models. 
For the user interface of the BPMN extension the open source project [BPMN.iO](https://bpmn.io/) was used as a basis. BPMN.iO provides tools that enable the creation of BPMN 2.0 models in the browser.
