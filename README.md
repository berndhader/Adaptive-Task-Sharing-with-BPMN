# BPMN-Extension for Franka Emika Desk

## About
The BPMN-Desk extension enables the creation and execution of collaborative human-robot processes using the collaborative robot Panda by Franka Emika.  

Business Process Model and Notation (short BPMN) is a visual modeling language for business processes. By using a so-called BPMN-engine since version 1.2 also the execution of the processes is possible. For the execution of the created human-robot processes Camunda BPM was used. Camunda BPM is a widespread open source project, which provides various tools for modelling as well as for executing BPMN 2.0 models. 
For the user interface of the BPMN extension the open source project BPMN.iO was used as basis. BPMN.iO provides tools that enable the creation of BPMN 2.0 models in the browser.
